A re-creation of Ian Haylock's design for a dual Atari/Commodore joystick adapter for the parallel port that will work even on machines with uni-directional parallel ports such as Acorn A3xx/A4xx/A540/A3000 as it only uses the BUSY input status signal for input.

This has been re-created previously by !FOZ! - I just decided to create my own layout, primarily for a smaller PCB.
